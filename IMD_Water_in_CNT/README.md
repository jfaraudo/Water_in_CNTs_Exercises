# IMD of Water in a Carbon Nanotube
Example of Interactive Molecular Dynamics (IMD).
Based on the Interactive Molecular Dynamics section of the official NAMD tutorial [Simulation of Water Permeation through Nanotubes](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/#nanotubes).

For a description of the models employed in the simulation and the input files see [here](https://saco.csic.es/index.php/s/rKXPoQZpNdrYRNZ)

We also provide example python scripts using MDAnalysis to analyze the trajectories (see [here](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/examples/quickstart.html) for a tutorial on How to Use MD Analysis)
