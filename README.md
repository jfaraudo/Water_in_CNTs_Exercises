# Simulation of Water in Carbon nanotubes
Exercises and examples of simulation of water inside a CNT and crossing of water across a CNT membrane.
Based on the official NAMD tutorial [Simulation of Water Permeation through Nanotubes](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/#nanotubes).

Cases available:
- Example of Interactive Molecular Dynamics (IMD) simulations 
- Exercise: simulation of water permeation across a CNT membrane

For a description of the models employed in the simulation and the input files see [here](https://saco.csic.es/index.php/s/rKXPoQZpNdrYRNZ)
